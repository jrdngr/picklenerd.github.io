I'm (slowly) learning how to digitally paint and in the process (very slowly) learning how to draw.  I've tried a bunch of different resources, but I've settled on [Proko's Figure Drawing][proko] course for the time being.  The course starts with gesture drawing and both Stan and his critique guest Marshall make a lot of comments about the massive number of gesture drawings a person needs to do before becoming good at them.  To make it as easy as possible, I tried out a bunch of slideshow programs to push me through 30-second quick sketches without me having to think too hard about timers and all that.  There really aren't any great options.  Everything is passable.

So I made one.  I didn't want to spent a whole lot of time on it because I just wanted something that worked, so I figured I'd throw something together with C# and WPF.  I've never actually done anything with WPF before and my only C# experience has been with Unity, so I thought it would be a fun exercise...

There's no twist here.  It took a weekend and came out great.  I was immediately using it for my own practice the night I started it and it was exactly what I wanted.  It went so well that I took a second weekend and made it something that I could share with the world.  It's called QuickDraw and you can get check it out [right here][quickdraw].

This really wasn't too far out for me since I write Java at work.  We use a lot of Swing and we're starting to use JavaFX.  I like to make fun of Java for being so feature-light compared to C# even though my only C# experience was through Unity, and my opinion has definitely stayed the same.  I'm going to miss properties so much when I got back to work.  I didn't use any tuples for this project, but I'm constantly missing them in Java.

Anyway, that was fun.  I'll definitely be going back to Rust for my personal projects just because it's fun and new.  I'll probably even port this over some day so that it's not Windows-only.  I have nothing against C# at all though.  I still think it's the best language of its kind.  It was nice to actually finish something that was immediately useful and I really appreciated how quickly I was able to get this done.  Next time I have an idea like this, I'll probably do it in WPF again.
